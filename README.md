### Hi everyone!

I'm a web developer from Latvia who created his first commercial website in html/css in 2002. 
Having worked as IT project manager for the main Latvian state portal Latvija.lv, in 2020 I took University of Michigan PHP specialization courses and fell in love with the frameworks Laravel and Vue. During last few years I have accumulated comprehensive knowledge regarding the development of modern websites. I am passionate to code myself, but IT project management experience and business IT education gives me a deep understanding of the business side of web projects as well. While being a proud member of the international community of Vue developers, my main field of interest lies in Laravel and PHP. 

Recent projects:

2. Web application that uses external news feed API to display JSON data in the application. PHP OOP. Codelex.
